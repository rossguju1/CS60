# Mini Overlay Network
## Ross Guju
Use the provided Makefile to build the code. 

We use the following four hosts to build the overlay network: 
* host1: flume.cs.dartmouth.edu
* host2: moose.cs.dartmouth.edu
* host3: wildcat.cs.dartmouth.edu
* host4: whaleback.cs.dartmouth.edu

The overlay process should be running on these four hosts. 

To start overlay on a host: go to overlay directory and run `./overlay&` -- make sure you switch directory, else you will get error when running overlay in the top directory. All overlay process should be started within 1 minute.

Then start the network processes on all 4 nodes. The network process should be started after the local overlay network is initialized and 
shows "Overlay: waiting for connection from MNP process...". 

To start network layer on a host: go to network directory and run `./network`.

To kill the overlay processes and network processes: use `kill -s 2 processID`. Here `-s 2` is the same as pressing CTRL+C to stop the process execution. 

If the ports used by the program are used already, the program will exit.

### File breakdown:
##### common directory:
* constants.h: overlay and network layer parameters
* pkt.h: definition of MNP packets and related data structures
* pkt.c: implementation of interfaces to send/receive MNP packets using the overlay layer

##### network directory:
* network.h: definition of MNP functions
* network.c: implementation of the MNP process

##### overlay directory:
* neighbortable.h: definitions of data structures and APIs for neighbor table 
* neighbortable.c: implementation of APIs for the neighbor table 
* overlay.h: definitions of functions used by ON process
* overlay.c: implementation of an ON process

##### topology directory:
* topology.dat: topology file 
* topology.h: definitions of functions to parse the topology file
* topology.c: implementation of functions to parse the topology file
