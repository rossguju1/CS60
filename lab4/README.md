# Mini Network Protocol 

Four machines are used: flume, moose, wildcat, and whaleback. 

### Building and running:

Use the provided Makefile to build the code. 

To run the application:

1. start the overlay processes: 
	at each node, go to the overlay/ directory, run `./overlay&`. The overlay processes on 4 nodes should be started within 1 minute. Wait until you see "waiting for connection from MNP process..." before moving to step 2. 

2. start the network processes: 
	at each node, go to the network/ directory, run `./network&`. Wait until you see "waiting for connection from MRT process..." before moving to step 3. 

3. start the transport processes and run the application:
	at one node, go to the server directory, run `./simple_server` or `./stress_server`; 
	at another node, go to the client directory: run `./app_simple_app` or `./app_stress_app`. 

To stop the program:

use `kill -s 2 processID` to kill the network processes and overlay processes. 

If the port numbers used by the program are used already, the program exits.
